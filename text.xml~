		<subtitle>What do we do?</subtitle>
Our core activity is to provide students with complementary education, bringing a significant added value to the education provided by the universities.

BEST works as well for increasing educational involvement of the students, stepping up their awareness on issues related to engineering education and improving engineering education in Europe through the input of those students.

We strain to help students to acquire the needed skills for working in international working teams. We value everything we learn through the experience of being involved in our activities and we strive to learn as much as possible from every aspect of our work.

We show the students the importance of tolerance and respect in interpersonal relationships, since we find them essential values for reaching a better understanding between European cultures.
How we do it?
Therefore we create opportunities for the students to meet and learn from one another through our academic and non-academic courses and educational symposia. More than 1500 students make possible to organise about 125 international events every year.
Benefits of being a BESTie

We often say that through the experience in BEST we gain a lot of knowledge and experience, useful for our future career and future life in general. But what exactly makes a BEST member special?

STRONG ANALYTICAL SKILLS due to their quantitative studies, mainly Engineering.

TRANSVERSAL COMPETENCES from HR to oral presentation, analysis/project management, leadership, teamwork, budgeting, negotiation.

MOBILITY BEST members are used to work "on the road" and travel around europe on short time notice.

INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE In every BEST event we have, on average, 14 different countries. At the end of his involvement, a BEST member has visited at least 5 different countries, and participated to 10 different events. We are not just internationally minded, we are internationally rooted.

LONG TERM VISION of their projects: starting from the current situation, evaluating all the variables and other concurrent activities until reaching a bigger view. And...in our BEST life we always work on real projects that have outcomes in the real world.

KNOWLEDGE SHARING In BEST we know how to share our knowledge, even when we communicate between very different cultures. Example: a successful strategy implemented in Rome, is immediately shared and implemented in Vienna, Copenhagen, Sofia...

PASSION hard work in BEST while keeping studying at University

For example, in order to run its year long activity and services free of charge for students, every Local Group engages fundraising activities through cooperation with Companies and Institutions. They do act, manage and work like a small "start-up" company.

Thanks to the extra skills acquired during their BEST experience, our Alumni are now in some of the biggest and most prestigious corporations: P&G, Shell, Bain&Company, McKinsey&Company, Credit Suisse, Accenture, Airbus, Citibank, IBM, Honeywell, Schlumberger, Whirlpool, etc.
